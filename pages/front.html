<h3>About this website</h3>
<p>
    This website is currently statically hosted with no special routing features. This may change in the future as I work on more content.
    In order to reduce bandwidth usage and avoid redundant boilerplate, the site is a single-page site, which loads new "pages" by inserting their content into the main body via Javascript. This means the site template only ever has to be loaded once.

</p>
<p>
    The code for the site itself can be found <a href="https://github.com/cody-pa/cody-pa.github.io">here</a>. When a custom-coded webserver has been made official, a link will be added to it as well.
